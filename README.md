Hi, I'm Florim ðŸ‘‹ a digital enthusiast with a passion for making things better with technology. 
 
I'm continuously expanding my technical expertise in:
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript/Typescript
- Frontend frameworks such as Next.js & Nuxt
- Git

I work full-time as a digital business analyst. In my spare time I run a digital agency called [Aureate Digital](https://www.aureatedigital.com.au), which gives me an opportunity to flex my web development skills.  

I post about my developer journey, ideas, challenges, projects & anything I find interesting on [florim.dev](https://www.florim.dev)
